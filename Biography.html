                "I, Garet Omorowa, was born and raised in Benin City, where my curiosity and passion for technology first began. Over the past five years, I have worked on various projects, collaborating with talented teams and continuously learning and growing.
                When I'm not coding,am prolly not doing something better just gaming :] I currently reside in Toronto, where I am excited to continue my journey and pursue new opportunities.
                This is my story so far, and I am eager to see what the future holds."
